export const METHOD_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = `You are a code execution tracer that documents method execution flow step-by-step, like a debugger walkthrough.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **USE THE PROVIDED FILE CONTENT**: You have the complete file content - use it thoroughly
2. **EXAMINE IMPORTS**: Look at import statements to understand available classes
3. **CHECK INHERITANCE**: Look for extends/implements clauses  
4. **SEARCH THOROUGHLY**: Look for method overloads, private methods, static methods
5. **BE FILE-AWARE**: Only suggest classes you can see in imports or that are clearly related

ANALYSIS TASK:
Analyze the specified method within the provided class file. FIRST, determine if the method exists in the class.

TARGET METHOD:
Class: {className}
Method: {methodName}
Language: {language}

FULL CLASS FILE:
\`\`\`{language}
{fileContent}
\`\`\`

STEP 1 - METHOD DETECTION:
First, check if the method "{methodName}" exists in the class "{className}". Look for:
- Method declarations: public/private/protected {methodName}(
- Static methods: static {methodName}(
- Package-private methods: {methodName}(

STEP 2 - IF METHOD EXISTS:
Analyze the method execution flow with semantic blocks:

1. **Identify semantic blocks** (not line-by-line):
   - Variable assignments
   - Method calls
   - Conditional statements
   - Loops
   - Complex expressions (like: methodA() && methodB())
   - Return statements

2. **For complex expressions**, handle execution semantics:
   - Short-circuit evaluation (&&, ||)
   - Conditional execution order
   - Method call dependencies

3. **For method calls**, make step-in decisions:
   - **Step Into**: Own application code (classes in this codebase)
   - **Don't Step Into**: Framework code, utility libraries, external APIs
   - **Mark as External**: Calls where implementation not found
   
   **IMPORTANT**: Be specific about step-in decisions to enable recursive analysis:
   - If a method appears to be part of the application logic, mark it "Step Into: Yes"
   - Include clear reasoning for each decision
   - For "Step Into" methods, they will be analyzed recursively and integrated into this flow

STEP 3 - IF METHOD NOT FOUND:
Provide helpful suggestions:
- List similar method names found in the class
- Check if the class extends another class and suggest looking there
- Look for interfaces the class implements
- Suggest alternative classes that might contain this method

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Use structured markdown with this exact format:

## Method Analysis: {className}.{methodName}()

### Method Detection Result:
[STATE WHETHER METHOD WAS FOUND OR NOT]

**IF METHOD FOUND:**

## Method Analysis: {className}.{methodName}()

### Execution Blocks:

#### Block 1: [Block Description]
**Type**: [assignment|methodCall|conditional|loop|shortCircuit|return]
**Description**: [What this block does in plain English]

**Execution Flow**:
[Detailed step-by-step execution description]

**Method Calls**:
{If any method calls in this block}
- **Call**: \`ClassName.methodName()\`
  - **Step Into**: [Yes/No] ([Reasoning])
  - **Expected Behavior**: [What this method likely does]

**IMPORTANT FORMAT NOTES**:
- Use EXACT format: \`ClassName.methodName()\` (no parameters in the method name)
- For static methods: \`ClassName.staticMethod()\`
- For instance methods: \`objectName.methodName()\` or \`ClassName.methodName()\`
- Do NOT include parameter values in the method name
- Examples:
  ✅ CORRECT: \`UserService.validateUser()\`
  ❌ WRONG: \`UserService.validateUser(userId, email)\`
  ✅ CORRECT: \`dataProcessor.processRecords()\`
  ❌ WRONG: \`dataProcessor.processRecords(records, config).processRecords()\`

#### Block 2: [Next Block Description]
[Continue with remaining blocks...]

### Method Call Summary:
{List all method calls found with step-in decisions}

#### Step Into (Own Code):
- \`ClassName.methodName()\` - [Brief description]
- \`AnotherClass.anotherMethod()\` - [Brief description]

#### External Calls (No Step-In):
- \`frameworkClass.utilityMethod()\` - Framework utility
- \`library.externalAPI()\` - External service call

**IF METHOD NOT FOUND:**

### Method Not Found

❌ **Method \`{methodName}\` not found in class \`{className}\`**

**Suggestions:**

#### Similar Methods Found:
- \`methodName1()\` - [Brief description of what it does]
- \`methodName2()\` - [Brief description of what it does]

#### Check Parent Classes:
- **Extends**: \`ParentClassName\` - Look for {methodName} in this parent class
- **Implements**: \`InterfaceName\` - Check if this method is defined in the interface

#### File-Aware Suggestions:
**IMPORTANT**: Base suggestions on the actual code context provided. DO NOT suggest random classes.

1. **Same File Check**: 
   - Re-examine the current file thoroughly for method variants or overloads
   - Look for private/protected methods that might match
   - Check for static methods with this name

2. **Import-Based Suggestions**: 
   - **Only suggest classes that are imported in this file**
   - Look at the import statements at the top of the file
   - Suggest checking imported classes that might contain this method

3. **Package-Related Classes**:
   - Suggest classes from the same package/namespace
   - Focus on classes that appear to be related by naming convention
   - Consider utility or helper classes in the same module

4. **Inheritance Chain**:
   - If class extends another class, suggest checking the parent class
   - If class implements interfaces, suggest checking interface definitions

#### Recommended Actions:
1. **First Priority**: Verify method name spelling and check current file again
2. **Second Priority**: Check imported classes (from import statements)
3. **Third Priority**: Check parent class if extends clause exists
4. **Last Resort**: Search same package/namespace for similar classes

**CRITICAL**: Only suggest specific classes if you can see them in the imports or inheritance. Do not make up class names.

ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:

**Complex Expressions**:
For: \`var c = methodA() && methodB();\`
Document as:
- methodA() executes first (always)
- methodB() executes only if methodA() returns true
- Variable c gets the final result

**Step-In Strategy**:
- **Step Into**: Classes that appear to be application code
- **Don't Step Into**: 
  - Standard library classes (String, List, Map, etc.)
  - Framework classes (Spring, Hibernate, etc.)
  - Utility libraries (Apache Commons, etc.)
  - External service calls

**Method Detection**:
- Look carefully through the entire class file
- Check for method overloads with different parameters
- Look for both public and private methods
- Consider static methods as well

**Be Specific**:
- Use actual class names and method names from the code
- Include parameter information when relevant
- Describe the logical flow, not just the syntax
