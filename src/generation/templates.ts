{codeAnalysis}

Based on this code analysis, generate a comprehensive requirements document following this EXACT format:

# Requirements Document: {className}{methodName}

## Introduction

Provide a clear business context introduction explaining what this code accomplishes from a user/business perspective.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: [Core Functionality]

**User Story:** As a [user type], I want [capability], so that [business value].

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN [condition] THEN the system SHALL [behavior]
2. WHEN [condition] THEN the system SHALL [behavior]
3. WHEN [condition] THEN the system SHALL [behavior]
4. WHEN [condition] THEN the system SHALL [behavior]
5. WHEN [condition] THEN the system SHALL [behavior]

### Requirement 2: [Secondary Functionality]

**User Story:** As a [user type], I want [capability], so that [business value].

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN [condition] THEN the system SHALL [behavior]
2. WHEN [condition] THEN the system SHALL [behavior]
3. WHEN [condition] THEN the system SHALL [behavior]
4. WHEN [condition] THEN the system SHALL [behavior]
5. WHEN [condition] THEN the system SHALL [behavior]

[Continue with 6-10 total requirements covering all aspects: validation, error handling, integration, configuration, data persistence, security, performance, etc.]

## Dependencies and Constraints

List any technical dependencies, business constraints, or integration requirements.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Focus on WHAT the system should do, NOT HOW it should be implemented
- Write from business/product perspective, not technical implementation
- Use SHALL language for definitive requirements
- Each requirement must have exactly 5 acceptance criteria
- Cover functional, non-functional, integration, and operational requirements
- Do not mention specific classes, methods, or technical architecture details
- Write as if this is a specification for building the feature from scratch`;
