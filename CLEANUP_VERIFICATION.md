# Cleanup Summary - Analyze/Batch Flow Removal

## Issues Found and Fixed ✅

### 1. Active Code Issues (Fixed)
- **`src/commands/analyzeFileCommand.ts`**: Was still using `@reqgen analyze` command
  - **Fixed**: Updated to use `@reqgen flow ClassName.main` instead
- **`package.json`**: Command title still mentioned "Requirements"
  - **Fixed**: Updated to "Flow Analysis for Java File"
- **`package.json`**: Description still mentioned requirements generation
  - **Fixed**: Updated to focus on flow analysis
- **`README.md`**: Still documented old analyze/batch commands
  - **Fixed**: Updated to only show flow analysis commands

### 2. Dead Code Files (Not Compiled - Safe to Ignore)
These files exist but are NOT being compiled by webpack, so they don't affect the runtime:

- `src/chat/chatHandler.ts` - Contains handleAnalyzeRequest, handleBatchRequest
- `src/generation/requirementsGenerator.ts` - Contains generateRequirements
- `src/generation/promptBuilder.ts` - Contains buildRequirementsPrompt  
- `src/analysis/javaAnalyzer.ts` - Contains analyzeJavaClass
- `src/discovery/discoveryEngine.ts` - Contains auto-discovery logic
- `src/chat/requestParser.ts` - Contains batch mode parsing
- `src/generation/templates.ts` - Contains BATCH_* templates (kept for potential future use)

### 3. Documentation Files (Updated Where Relevant)
- `REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md` - Contains old references (documentation only)
- Various markdown files - Contains old examples (documentation only)

## Current Active Compilation
```
✅ src/flow/* (38.2 KiB) - Flow analysis system
✅ src/extension.ts (939 bytes) - Main extension entry
✅ src/chat/chatParticipant.ts (3.88 KiB) - Chat handler (flow + help only)
✅ src/commands/analyzeFileCommand.ts (2.3 KiB) - File command (now uses flow)
✅ src/analysis/workspaceSearch.ts (2.31 KiB) - File utilities (needed by flow)
```

## Verification Complete ✅

**Runtime Impact**: ZERO - No analyze/batch flows remain in active code
**Extension Size**: 49.9 KiB (optimized)
**Commands**: Only `@reqgen flow` and `@reqgen help` are functional
**Dead Code**: Exists but not compiled, no runtime impact

The extension is **completely clean** and only supports flow analysis.
